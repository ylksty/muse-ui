[Snackbar & Toast](https://material.google.com/components/snackbars-toasts.html) Snackbar is a feedback mechanism which is lightweight, always to represent with a small pop up box, and appear in the bottom of mobile screen or desktop. They can have the largest z-index.

They will disappear automatically when they are time out or user click other position of screen. When they are appearing, it should not influence the user`s operation, and also not support the input. One page should be only one snack bar.
